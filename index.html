                                <p>The official year of founding Vitebsk is 974, based on an anachronistic legend that it was founded by Olga of Kiev, but the first mention in historical record is from 1021, when Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev gave it to Bryachislav Izyaslavich, Prince of Polotsk</p>
                                <p>n the 12th and 13th centuries Vitebsk was the capital of the Principality of Vitebsk, an appanage principality which thrived at the crossroads of the river routes among the Baltic and Black seas. In 1320 the city was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a dowry of the Princess Maria, the first wife of Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas. By 1351 the city had erected a stone Upper and Lower Castle, the prince's palace. In 1410 Vitebsk participated in the Battle of Grunwald. In 1597, the townsfolk of Vitebsk were privileged with Magdeburg rights. However, the rights were taken away in 1623 after the citizens revolted against the imposed Union of Brest and killed Archbishop Josaphat Kuntsevych. During the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Vitebsk was annexed by the Russian Empire.</p>

                                <p>t makes sense to start the first meeting with Vitebsk in the Local History Museum, where, as if with threads, a hard historical path of the city has been collected and woven into single linen.

                                <p>Today the Botanical Garden occupies a special place among the number of the most beautiful parks in Vitebsk. And there are several reasons. One of them is the fact that the garden is located on the right bank of the picturesque Vitba River. The second secret is that here one of the richest collections has been prepared, which shows amazing plants not only from Belarus, but also from around the world.</p>

                                <p>It so happened that this trip to Vitebsk first, it was not possible to visit there before. And I visited the city almost immediately after the Russian Smolensk (which was also the first time). You can wait for the photo report from that trip and compare the city itself (and the comparison is correct: the city with a common history and a social status), but you can speed up the process. Smolensk looks very dim at the background of Vitebsk. It may surprise you, but Smolensk massively go to Vitebsk: for shopping, coffee, for the holidays, the New Year. For them, Vitebsk, Vilnius both for us - the real Europe. And it pleases.</p>
